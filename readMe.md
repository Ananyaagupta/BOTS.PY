The current process of sorting,setting and renewing the agreements is tedious and full of confusion and chaos. To solve this problem we present to you <b>Agreemi</b>. With the motto of bridging the gap between manufacturers and vendors, agreemi promises to optimise and digitize the entire process and be a game changer in the industry.
